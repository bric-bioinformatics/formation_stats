## What is a statistic ?

Whether in marketing (products), agronomy (plants), or clinical research (patients), we work with entities that differ from one another: this is what we call **variability**.

In an ideal world, to answer a question, we would work with all the individuals who are affected by our question. For example, I want to study the different mechanisms of liver cancer. I could then collect data from all patients with liver cancer worldwide. This corresponds to the **population**.

For obvious reasons of resources and time, it is impossible to work with an entire population. We then work on a **sample**.

**Sampling** is an important process because it must be as representative as possible of a **population**.

It is in this basic context that **statistics** come into play. Their purpose is to provide a numerical summary of a **sample** that will estimate the characteristics of a **population**.
